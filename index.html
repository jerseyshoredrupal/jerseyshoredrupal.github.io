            <h2>Asbury Park, NJ, United States</h2>
            <p>Join like-minded Drupal contributors for two full days of core and contrib sprinting to further advance Drupal 8! Attendees will work on critical core issues and release blockers, as well as upgrading contrib modules. It is amazing what can happen when people come together!</p>

            <h3 id="agenda">Agenda</h3>
            <p>Each day will begin at 9:30am with a quick organizing and  discussion session followed by forming groups and working on issues. Our goal is to keep all attendees focused on contributing, so we will provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks throughout the day. On Saturday night we will go out on the town for dinner, followed by an evening of continued sprinting with beer and other refreshments.</p>
